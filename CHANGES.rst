Version 2.0.0
-------------

Shivashis Padhi created the fundament for a collaboration server in the
MSS project in google summer of code 2019.
Tanish Grover continued this work in the google summer of code 2020 and
overworked our user interface. The initial idea of mscolab stems from Reimar Bauer.
GSoC mentors were Reimar Bauer and Jörn Ungermann.
In addition to the mswms server the project now has a mscolab server for editing a flight path.

Vaibhav Mehra has integrated an editor for the MSS setting file.

The KML docking widget was improved in google summer of code 2020 by Aryan Gupta.
GSoC mentors were Jörn Ungermann and Christian Rolf. Initial idea of the project by Jörn Ungermann.

HINT:
~~~~~

With 1.7.0 we move to Python 3. At current state we still support Python 2. But as Python 2 will retire  we have
 to move on.
This release therefore has many refactoring changes. We removed PyQT4 because it is not compatible to PyFilesystem2.
We decided to use PyFilesystem2 because of its unified great API for internal or external storages. This enables
 for example to store flightpathes on a webdav server or other web storages by just entering a fs url.

Hint:
~~~~~

DefaultDataAccess
+++++++++++++++++

With 1.6.0 we introduced a DefaultDataAccess Class. This requires a change in your server configuration.
This is an example from demodata.
data = {
   "ecmwf_EUR_LL015": mslib.mswms.dataaccess.DefaultDataAccess(_datapath, "EUR_LL015"),
}
This class substitutes all previous defined classes for data access.
The Constructor needs information on data path and domain ID, see documentation.
Also we replaced the name from nwpaccess to data.
The vt_cache caching was removed.

WMS Server
++++++++++
The server does not need a restart by new data. Any get capability request by the user loads the recent data.

~~~~~
This version has a lot of refactoring work.

Because authentication can happen as different user than the one driving the mss server
we have moved the password setup to mss_wms_auth.py
