# Identity Provider with PySAML2 Integration

This repository contains an Identity Provider (IdP) implementation that enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication using PySAML2.

## Getting Started

To get started with the IdP, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `conf_sp_idp/idp` folder.
2. Run the following command to start the IdP:
    `python3 idp.py idp_conf`
    This will launch the Identity Provider with the specified configuration.
3. Access the IdP using the provided URL and begin the SSO authentication process.

That's it! You are now ready to use the Identity Provider for SSO authentication.
