     :alt: This is the waypoints tutorial,i.e., whenever we are going to plan
           a flight track, we have to place the waypoints in some places and,
           form a flight path.
           The origin is set at Nagpur, New Delhi being the first way point.
           Clicking ADD WAY POINT BUTTON, we can add new way points.
           The WAY POINTS 2,3,4 and 5 are added at required locations.
           We are moving the WAY POINT NO.5 by clicking the MOVE WAY POINT button.
           We can see that blue dot is demonstrating the click and we hit a WAY POINT.
           Now, we are going to delete a WAY POINT, it is asking for the confirmation to delete it or not.
           For placing the WAY POINTS and other operations, we have options to select Europe, Germany, and so on.
           Selecting GLOBAL displays the  world map.
           For a customised map, we can click on zoom button, and drag the cursor over map, clicking left.
           We can also pan the map.
           Clicking Left and Right arrow buttons changes the map region to previous and next respectively.
           Clicking Home button on the top left shows the global view of the map.
           Finally we can save the map by clicking SAVE button. This saves the image in .png format.
