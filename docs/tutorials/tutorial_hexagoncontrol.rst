Table View and Hexagon Flight Patterns
--------------------------------------

For tomographic imaging, a hexagonal flight pattern can be integrated by a docking widget of Table View

   .. video:: ../_static/mp4/tutorial_hexagoncontrol.mp4
     :alt: Top View windows is opened by CTRL+H.
           We select the global (cyl) for the world map.
           Zooming in for the required region.
           Assuming Delhi as the center we are to place waypoints around it in a hexagonal fashion.
           Opening Tableview. It contains the latitudinal and longitudinal locations of waypoints.
           Doing this manually will not be perfect and hence, hexagon control!
           Clicking on (Select to open control), and selecting (hexagonal control)
           This screen can be  used to place the latitude and longitude of center, and radius of hexagon.
           We can see the changes in the Top View.
           Angle of first point can also be changed, which is by default set at 0.
