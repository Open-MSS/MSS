es can be displayed in the Top View. Color and line width can be adjusted.

     :alt: Open the TopView (CTRL+H)
           After clicking on "(select to open control)", click on KML OVERLAY. The UI will look as shown.
           KML files can be used to show the geographical boundary which helps in planning the WAY POINTS.
           We can put the WAY POINTS along this line. We will now see how to add, move, select KML files.
           We can see two KML files here, one is COLOR.KML ; and the another one is FOLDER.KML.
           COLOR.KML is in black colour, FOLDER.KML is denoted by black colour.
           The box is checked that shows that these KML files are shown in the map, if unchecked, it will not show.
           Now, we will add KML files by clicking on ADD KML FILES.
           The dialogue will be opened and it will add the path where the KML file is present.
           You can also select it through the file dialogue.
           When we add a KML file, the default colour is Black and the default linewidth is 2 units.
           Now, let's change colour and line width of the KML files. Before that, we add another KML file.
           Both the KML files will be opened when we will open the GLOBAL map.
           Both the files are in black colour.
           Now, we will change colour of FOLDER.KML file by selecting it and clicking on CHANGE COLOUR.
           We change it from Black to blue followed by blue to green.
           Changing it for some time...
           Now, we change line width by changing its numerical value whose range is 0 to 10.
           We change it to different values to obtain different linewidths.
           The top view is closed and the tutorial ends.
