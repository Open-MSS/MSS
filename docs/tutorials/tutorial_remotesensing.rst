Top View and Remotesensing Tools
--------------------------------

In order to be able to take into account the viewing angle and solar level for measuring instruments, the remotesensing tools are used

     :alt: This is the Remote Sensing Section of the Top View.
           It shows the position and angle of the flight from any particular object in the sky.
           Azimuth is the forward direction line of the flight. If we go above tHE AZIMUTH, angle is in positive,
           and if we descend down, angle is in negative.
           The Top View (CTRL+H) will be used to see what "Remote Sensing Tools" is.
           From "(select to open control)", we select- "Remote Sensing Tools".
           Our main objective here is to find out the disturbance in visibility due to light source
           from any illuminating object like sun.
           The solar angle colour in dark to light is 0 to 15 for RED and 15 to 45 for violet and 45 to 180 for green.
           We can show angles relative to "sun", "venus" and"moon".
           "total (horizon)"  is the light of the surroundings of the flight.
           We will add some WAY POINTS numbered as 2,3,4,5.
           After clicking on "show agle (degree)", the flight track's colour has changed to green or light green.
           The flight is at 90° from azimuth and -1 shows that flight is descended down from azimuth by one degree.
           Showing the colours in the flight path connecting waypoints, green colour here shows that our solar angle
           is in range from 45 to 180 degree.
           We will now look for "moon". There is no significant change.
           And for "venus", the colour of way point changed to light green.
           Changing "total (horizon)" to "total" changes the colour of way point from green to violet.
           Changing "total (horizon)" to "elevation" changes the colour of way point from green to red.
           Now for "venus", after changing the angle from 90 to 45 degree, the color changed to light green.
           Changing "elevation" from -1 to -2 or -3 degree doesn't bring any significant change in colour of the way point.
           We will now look for "draw tangent points". We can choose colors for the tangent points.
           We keep it red for clear vision.
           kilometers can also be changed to know the distance of tangent point.
           We zoom it for for more understanding. The flight path is able to view a distance of 20 km from
           the help of tangent point.
           The tangent lines changes its direction on changing angle to 120° as it changes clockwise on increasing
           the angles or 75° as it changes anticlockwise on decreasing the angles.
