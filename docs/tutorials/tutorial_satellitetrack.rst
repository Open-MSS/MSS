Top View and  Satellite Overflight
----------------------------------

To combine a flight path with a satellite overflight, the remotesensing widget is used.

     :alt: This is Satellite Tracking Prediction System that can be used to check the accuracy of the path
           travelled by a Satellite by the help of data collected from different space agencies and planning a flight accordingly.
           These flights which can be refered to as the Testing flights are made to travel in
           the direction of these Satellites by collaborating with these space agencies.
           Open the top view of the MSS software.
           Click on Select to Open control and then click Satellite Tracks.
           You will see the option :“File with predicted satellite track” where you can load the file retrieved from the space agencies.
           After opening it, the “Predicted Satellite Overpasses” gets activated where you can put the time and date frames for the overpassing satellite to be checked.
           Click on the Link given below in blue color to add new files for predicting Satellite track.
           Select the date and time frame from the drop down menu for which you want to check the overpassing of the Satellite.
           We traverse through the various options of date and time inside the overpass selector for a while.
           After selecting the Time Frame, Zoom in the map to see the Satellite Tracks.
           Select the Starting way point and the ending way point in parallel to the flight as shown by the satellite overpasses path.
