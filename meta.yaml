  MSS - Mission Support System

  http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/55/2012/gmd-5-55-2012.pdf

  Software for planning research Aircraft Missions.
  For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights,
  the Mission Support System (MSS) was developed.
  This software helps to review a big amount of metereological and
  model data by viewing the forecasted parameters of interest along possible regions
  of a proposed flight path. Data and possible flight paths can
  be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on a vertical
  view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can be constructed
  and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table is also possible.
