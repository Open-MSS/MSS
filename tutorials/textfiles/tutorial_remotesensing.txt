This is the REMOTE SENSING SECTION of the TOP VIEW. It shows the position and angle of the flight from any particular object in the sky.

AZIMUTH is the forward direction line of the flight. If we go above tHE AZIMUTH, angle is in positive, and if we descend down, angle is in negative.

The TOP VIEW will be used to see what REMOTE SENSING is.

From SELECT TO OPEN CONTROL, we select- REMOTE SENSING.

Our main objective here is to find out the disturbance in visibility due to light source from any iluminating object like sun.

The solar angle colour in dark to light is 0 to 15 for RED and 15 to 45 for violet and 45 to 180 for green.

We can show angles relative to SUN, VENUS, and MOON. 

TOTAL HORIZON  is the light of the surroundings of the flight.

We will add some WAY POINTS numbered as 2,3,4,5.

After clicking on SHOW ANGLES, the flight track's colour has changed to green or light green.

The flight is at 90° from azimuth and -1 shows that flight is descended down from azimuth by one degree. 

Showing the colours in the flight path connecting waypoints, green colour here shows that our solar angle is in range from 45 to 180 degree.

We will now look for MOON. There is no significant change. 

And for VENUS, the colour of way point changed to light green.

Changing TOTAL HORIZON to TOTAL changes the colour of way point from green to violet.

Changing TOTAL HORIZON to ELEVATION changes the colour of way point from green to red.

Now for VENUS, after changing the angle from 90 to 45 degree, the color changed to light green.

Changing ELEVATION from -1 to -2 or -3 degree doesn't bring any significant change in colour of the way point.

We will now look for DRAW TANGENT POINTS. We can choose colors for the TANGENT POINTS. 

We keep it red for clear vision.

KILOMETERS can also be changed to know the distance of tangent point.

We zoom it for for more understanding. The flight patch is able to view a distance of 20 km from the help of TANGENT POINT.

The tangent lines changes its direction on changing angle to 120° as it changes clockwise on increasing the angles or 75° as it changes anticlockwise on decreasing the angles.
